Theme: Two Button Control + Growing
Can use both or either

Puzzler
- Only two buttons, but what the buttons do changes?
- Move something towards an exit?
- Grows over time?
    - Speed aspect?
        - Got to get to the end before you grow too much?
- As you grow the map changes to reflect you getting bigger?
    - Spore type thing
- Buttons don't have to be for movement as such
    - Indirectly control your movement
        - Tilting the board
            - Reversing gravity
-----------------------------
- Two buttons, both movement
- Have to navigate from one side to the other
    - Lowest number of moves
- The tile you are standing on decides what each button does(one moves up or down, one moves left or right)
    - Pokemon team rocket base type thing where some tiles make you move until you hit a wall
    - Some tiles can be moved by walking into them
    - Some tiles tp you?
- Level design going to be very difficult
    - Need to have a good number of levels
        - At least 10
- Software buttons that show the possible moves
------------------------------



Platformer
    - Infinite Runner
        - Map has some floor in the sky, have to reverse gravity
            - 1 button to flip gravity, one to attack
                - If you hit a enemy and you are smaller it kills you
                    - If you are bigger you survive but shrink
                        - You grow over time and can get pickups to speed it up
                - Ranged weapons
        - Might be difficult to make challenging/ actually fun
            - Flip gravity, attack, flip gravity, attack, repeat probably a bit boring after a while
